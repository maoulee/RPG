"""Tool JSON schemas + dispatch for the native tool-calling agent.

Schemas are the surface the model sees; dispatch executes each accepted tool
against a CaseContext using the ROBUST shared engines (GTE, k_queue_traverse,
compress_paths) — imported, never modified.

Key design: `retrieve` is MODEL-DRIVEN — the model's `subquestion` is the GTE

miss diagnosed in the stage pipeline.

    presentation — so the overview shows CVT-expanded candidates (Kasich, not
    CVT node IDs) and a trie structure, not a flat list.

    The model uses this overview to SELECT which branch to expand (Stage 7's
    role), then expand_branches(['N']) drills into the chosen branch (Stage 8's role).

    Conjunctive layers: a step group with several fids (a ``con`` group from
    ``question_chains``) means those facts constrain the SAME entity reached by
    the prior step — they are NOT sequential hops. Their selected relations are
    UNIONED into one step, mirroring stage's ``_merge_constraint_steps``. Without
    this merge the traversal would walk them in series (f2 → entity → f3), which
    is semantically wrong: both filters read attributes of the entity reached by
    the prior step, they don't chain. Grouping is explicit (the model writes
    ``con``), parsed into ``ctx.fact_steps`` by the harness.

"""Tool JSON schemas + dispatch for the native tool-calling agent.

Schemas are the surface the model sees; dispatch executes each accepted tool
against a CaseContext using the ROBUST shared engines (GTE, k_queue_traverse,
compress_paths) — imported, never modified.

Key design: `retrieve` is MODEL-DRIVEN — the model's `subquestion` is the GTE

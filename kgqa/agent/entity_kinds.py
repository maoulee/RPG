"""ENTITY KINDS — the single source of truth for entity classification
(cleanup charter C1, user ruling 2026-09-24: the data channel is
pattern-layer walk -> recorded pattern paths -> pattern paths restored to
entity evidence, with EVERY participant variable consistent across layers).

Four kinds:
  NAMED    — a displayable entity (answer surface, walk node)
  CVT      — event/record mediator node (m./g. prefix): transparent in
             walks, its attribute edges inline at render
  ID_NODE  — opaque code node (no space + 2+ consecutive digits, <=24
             chars): a transit surface exactly like a CVT (25_db96)
  LITERAL  — value node (dates, numbers, strings): legal terminal of a
             value-typed final hop (1812: [number: 610])

The walk/render/pool layers previously carried FIVE divergent copies of the
CVT predicate and THREE non-equivalent literal checks; this module is the
only place those distinctions live.

"""SEQ harness — boundary-only state machine for iterative subgraph retrieval.

States: INIT → decompose → RETRIEVE → DONE (answer accepted).

The harness enforces ONLY boundaries — it never decides which relation, which center
entity, or when to answer. Those are the model's job. The boundaries:
  - order:  decompose first; answer last.
  - to-do:  track declared facts vs retrieved facts → progress hint + answer guard.
  - answer guard: if the model answers before every declared fact is retrieved, it is
            reminded ONCE (rejected with the missing list); a second answer is accepted.

The DATA boundary (next center ∈ accumulated subgraph) is enforced in the tool
(seq_tools.retrieve_subgraph), not here, because it needs ctx.

SAPS baseline (react_loop / harness.py / tools.py) is untouched.
